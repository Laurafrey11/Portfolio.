# ⚙️ Automated Reporting Workflow – N8N & Power Automate

## 🧠 Business Problem
The company needed to generate reports with unstructure data and combining data from
multiple sources which they monthy done it manually. This process was repetitive, error-prone and time-consuming.

## 🗂 Process & Data Sources
- Excel / Google Sheets
- Databases

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Fabric
- Python
- JSON
- Power BI

## ⚙️ Solution
I designed a workflow that:
- Cleans and transforms data in a pipeline to create a usable semantic model
- A pipeline that runs a notebook with the python script to calculate the forecast of sales and quantity
- Updates dashboards automatically

## 🚀 Impact
- Significant reduction in manual clean up
- Improved data accuracy
- Faster access to updated insights
