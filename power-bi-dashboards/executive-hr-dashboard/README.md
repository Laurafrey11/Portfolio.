# 📊 Executive HR Dashboard – Power BI

## 🧠 Business Problem
The company needed a centralized view of key HR metrics to understand workforce
composition, employee turnover and absenteeism.

Manual reports made it difficult for HR leaders to identify trends and make
strategic decisions.

## 🗂 Data

- +10,000 employee records
- Includes headcount, departments, roles, hiring dates, absences and turnover

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

I designed an executive HR dashboard that allows users to:
